===================================================================

Technology: Unlagged is the proof of a simple concept developed by
Neil Toronto in order to allow HPB's to have a chance against all
the evil LPBs that roam the world of quake 3. In normal quake3 the
server only stores each players current position, however, in 
Unlagged the server stores your past positions and can look up to 
a half a second back in time. Every time a player makes a shot with
an instant-hit weapon (machinegun, shotgun, railgun, lightning) 
the server calculates where the player has been in order to find 
where the player should of been if it wasn't for latency (lag).

The only thing that you must understand is that Unlagged will not
reduce your ping or recover lost packets; It simply compensates for 
them. Because of this, when on an Unlagged server remember to always
shoot directly at your opponents; do not lead; just play like you
were playing a single-player game.

The technology can only do so much however, and once players pings
start reaching heights of 350 and above, the player is basically 
out of luck. 

Insta-Unlagged: Insta unlagged is the obvious next step of the 
Unlagged model. Not only is it proof that this simple concept works; 
it is every 56ker's dream. It has all the features of Instagib+ plus
it has many other features.

Current Features List:

 - Ability to change insta_weapon to any of the quake 3 weapons.
 - Custom countdown for weapon change.
 - Ability to change the cycle (Rate of Fire) of most quake 3 weapons.
 - Ability to change the spread of the machine gun and shotgun.
 - Ability to turn on/off falling damage.
 - Ability to turn on/off self damage.
 - Ability to control the amount of splash damage dealt by projectile 
   shooting weapons.
 - Ability to control knockback dealt by projectile weapons on self and
   seperately on the opponent.
 - Ability to control whether knockback to self is static or based off
   the distance you are from impact.
 - Ability to control the length of time that protection is provided on
   respawn (0 for no protection)
 - Ability to control whether players can fire while under protection.
 - Ability to control whether a warning is displayed to inform players
   that you cannot fire with protection if insta_protectionfire is set 	
   to 0.

   before they respawn.
 - Ability to control whether the server plays a HolyShit sound effect
   when players make kick-ass frags.

	      CFG Arena - by Aaron Storck (Paradox)
====================================================================

Look for this one to come out in a couple of weeks. It is
the ultimate server-side configurable mod. Over 200 variables to
modify; from speed of projectiles, rate of fire (cycle), which
weapons and how much ammo you start with to item placement on the map
which items spawn onto the map, how long it takes for them to
respawn, and much much more. And there are many added features
which include (but are not limited to): Homing rockets, proximity 
mines, vortex grenades, detonatables, cluster grenades, alternate fire,
accelerating rockets, client weapon weight control, and grapple hook.

You may be asking yourself, why is information about CFG Arena in this
readme? Its simple, CFG Arena also features Unlagged technology. And
like any other variable of CFG Arena it can be turned on or off in
real-time or by premade configuration files. You dont have to make
your configuration files by hand either. You can use an external
or internal CFG editor that comes along with the mod. Configurations
can also be assigned to maps, simply by adding the map name in the
cfg's name (eg: q3dm17configuration1.cfg).

Simply put, The possibilities are Endless!
