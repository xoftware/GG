John Carmack is a brilliant man, my childhood hero, and most of all, my first teacher and inspiration for programming. (By that, I mean you can actually teach through your work!) Ben Noordhuis is another one, actually, and the creators/contributors to the following stack are brilliant. None of these people know who I am, but this is simply a "clean-themed" fork standing on the shoulders of their work.

 + OpenArena(Quake 3)
 + QuakeJS(NodeJS/Emscripten)
 + Instagib(InstaUnlagged)

I have 2 stand-alone games in progress. They are passion projects, and I intend to find a way to integrate this web-stack for extra online features.
