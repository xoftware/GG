When I was a boy, my mother was a Catholic, and my father brought me Quake 3. 

No matter which one I chose, I was bound to lose. The two options put before me were really an illusion. Both were one in the same. The devil instituted the Catholic church to ensnare religious people, while at the same time offering the atheists theirs. People would come running, from one towards the other, expecting it to lay the better path. 

Rather than descend into the temple of blasphemy, I descended into the temple of blasphemy. Rather than animate motions as a hollow man trapped, I just animated motions as a hollow man trapped. Rather than bow before the grandiose arena of the antichrist, I bowed before the grandiose arena of the antichrist.

    "And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father, which is in heaven." -- Matthew 23:9

Christ is not about vain traditions, lofty prayers. He's not about following after a meaningless life. Nor exalting ourselves as holy and striving to live up to His law, for the sake of it, or even by our own means. He's not about us earning our way into Heaven, or our own fulfilment, or, what's most of all, even love.

The true definition of sorrow comes from the true definition of joy. God is truly so remarkable. He is who He is. That those who do not have Him bring sorrow to those who do. Oh, we would cry, that the Lord would open John Carmack's and the men at ID Softwares eyes. To see a man so far from God is truly why Jesus cried and forgave for those who persecuted and killed Him. 

The church is not where men do what is condemned by God's Word. The catholic popes even banned the Bible and hence literacy from the everyday people, like you and me. 

```
Then the Pharisees and scribes asked him, 
Why walk not thy disciples according to the tradition of the elders, 
but eat bread with unwashen hands?

He answered and said unto them, 
Well hath Esaias prophesied of you hypocrites, 
as it is written, 
This people honoureth me with their lips, 
but their heart is far from me.

Howbeit in vain do they worship me, 
teaching for doctrines the commandments of men.
--Mark 7:5-7
```

God condemns evil because He loves us. The church, according to God, is just people who belive in the truth, the way and the life, Jesus as their saviour. And as for the rest, we follow because we truly cherish Him, for He *is* the truth! 

No matter who we are, all the options we can get ourselves into are evil. But Jesus saves... and He will.

In this game, there is a cheat code to go into "God Mode." Well, let's go into "God Mode" for a second. You've heard it said before, "I only want what's best for you." We were made in God's image, and thusly make avatars in ours. Imagine if we could take you and expand you to infinite proportions, unlimited wisdom, infinite power, and strength. Then you could really look at your children and cousins and brothers and loved ones and say "I only want what's best for you." Well, that's exactly how God is. God, however, is perfect in *every* way, not to mention love, and He only wants what's best for us, Himself. 




Just as God has made me new, I am aiming to make this game new.
